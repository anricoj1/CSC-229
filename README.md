# What I learned
CSC 229 was a very interesting course. Most of our class time wasn't spent writing code.
We learned how Java worked in class mainly using a whiteboard and taking notes.
In a way this was challenging but forced the class to think about the problem before you coded it. Using the whiteboard gave a more clear demonstration rather than just showing code, our professor wanted us to understand what we are coding. Tests took place in only MS Word, we did not use the Eclipse IDE.
